# What I Learned Today (2025-08-04)

## 🌐 How the Internet Works (Simple Explanation)

- The Internet is a global network of computers that communicate using standard rules called **protocols** (like HTTP, TCP/IP).
- Your device sends a request (like opening google.com).
- That request travels via **routers**, **DNS servers**, and **Internet Service Providers** to reach the target server.
- The server sends back the requested data (webpage, file, etc.).
- Your browser displays it. All this happens in milliseconds!

> 🔁 Analogy: Like sending a letter — you write it, drop it in a postbox, it travels through various post offices (routers), and finally reaches the receiver (server).

## 🖥️ What is a Server?

- A **server** is a computer or software that provides services or resources to other computers (clients).
- For example, a web server sends web pages, a mail server sends/receives emails.

> 💡 In cloud computing, servers are often **virtual machines** hosted on data centers by companies like AWS, Azure, etc.

## 🎯 Reflection

- Learned how the web actually works behind the scenes.
- Now I understand what powers websites and cloud services — it all starts with **servers** and **protocols**.
